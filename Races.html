                    <h2>Soul reapers</h2>
                    <p id="paragraf-text">Shinigami (translated from japanese Death God/ Soul reaper) are souls with inner spiritual power, recruited from the ranks of the residents and nobility of Soul Society. Like all spirits, they cannot be detected by normal Humans. Shinigami use their Zanpakutō, supernatural swords that are the manifestation of their owners' power, to perform soul burials on Pluses (lost souls). Shinigami also use Zanpakutō and magic known as Kidō to fight Hollows.</p>
                    <p id="paragraf-text">Most Shinigami appear like average Humans. There are, however, a few Shinigami who are less Human-like in appearance. For example, there are much greater variations in body-sizes between Shinigami than between Humans, with small childlike Shinigami such as the 109 cm tall Yachiru Kusajishi and giant Shinigami such as Sajin Komamura, who is 288 cm tall. Variations do not just occur in size but in overall appearance, too, the most notable example being Captain Komamura, who is an anthropomorphic wolf.</p>
                    <p id="paragraf-text">Visoreds are Shinigamis who have also obtained Hollow powers, gaining a removable mask and certain abilities.</p>

                    <h2 id="title-black">Hollows</h2>
                    <p id="text-black">Hollows are a spiritual race of creatures which are born from Human souls who, for various reasons, do not cross over to Soul Society after their death and stay in the Human World for too long. They are corrupt spirits with supernatural powers which devour the souls of both living and deceased Humans. Hollows settle in Hueco Mundo, but can cross over to the Human World and Soul Society. </p>
                    <p id="text-black">Menos are created when the void within an ordinary Hollow's heart becomes so substantial Human souls are incapable of sustaining it, at which point it begins devouring fellow Hollows. These cannibal Hollows are attracted to one another, and a mass inter-devouring follows, resulting in a Gillian. Following this transformation, the Gillian can evolve twice more, first into an Adjuchas and finally into a Vasto Lorde

                    <p id="text-black">An Arrancar (Spanish for "To Tear Off", Japanese for "Ripped Mask") is a Hollow that has removed its mask and has gained Shinigami-like powers.</p>

                    <h2>Quincys</h2>
                    <p id="paragraf-text">The Quincy are a race of spiritual beings (notably Humans) that inherited their spiritual powers from Yhwach; having the ability to detect the existence of Hollows and other Souls. Most of the Quincy were exterminated by the Shinigami over 200 years ago in order to prevent the collapse of the worlds due to the Quincy over-hunting and destroying all Hollows they encountered. Quincy are the polar opposite of Shinigami.</p>
                    <p id="paragraf-text">While they are trained to confront Hollows in order to defeat them just as Shinigami do, the biggest difference between the Quincy and Shinigami, since ancient times, is whether or not to kill Hollows. The Shinigami purify Hollows with their Zanpakutō and send them to Soul Society, while the Quincy killed the Hollows. The idea can be seen as comparing justice and vengeance: "Hollows devour souls of Humans, so why must it be that those who harm and kill friends and relatives get sent peacefully to Soul Society?"</p>

                    <h2>Fullbringers</h2>
                    <p id="paragraf-text">Fullbringers are spiritually-aware Humans born with the eponymous ability Fullbring, which allows them to manipulate the souls that reside in all physical matter. By developing an affinity for a particular object, a Fullbringer can alter its form, granting powers that vary greatly among individuals. This affinity can be defined by one’s love for the object in question, or simply by an overall fondness for it. As such, this power is usually awakened through a strong emotion associated with the object, such as pride. Using this affinity, Fullbringers pull out the object’s soul and boost it with their own, transforming it in the process.</p>
                    <p id="paragraf-text"> A Fullbring's unique power largely depends on the object that is used as a focus. In addition to souls, material objects also possess memories. As its holder experiences various events, the object experiences them as well; the memories are engraved onto its soul each time it is touched. Because of this, Fullbringers who had a considerable amount of battle experience prior to awakening their power have stronger Fullbrings.</p>
